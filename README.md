# Honeywell Assessment Android
## Welcome to the Android Engineer Assessment!
The goal of this assessment is to create a simple Android application that displays a list of items and allows users to add and remove items from the list. Each element of the list should have 3 parameters: name, color coding, and either an image or a photo. Users should have the capacity to modify each parameter of each item.
To successfully complete this assessment, you will need to implement a good design pattern and follow design principles. 
### Instructions
+ Design the UI of the application, ensuring that it follows design principles, and is easy to use. This will involve designing a list view to display items, creating a form for adding new items, and providing controls for modifying existing items.
+ Implement the functionality for adding and removing items from the list, as well as modifying existing items. This will involve creating data binding between your UI controls and your data models, as well as creating functions to add, remove, and modify items in your list.
+ Ensure that each item in the list has three parameters: name, color coding, and an image or photo. Provide a selector for users to choose whether to attach an image or a photo to each item.
+ Use a good design pattern to organize your codebase. This will involve creating separate classes and functions for different features of your application.
+ Test your application thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning as expected. This will involve checking that users can add, remove, and modify items in the list, and that the application is visually appealing and easy to use.
+ Optimize the performance of your application to ensure that it runs smoothly on a range of Android devices.
### Considerations
+ Please **fork** this repo and commit as necessary
+ **do NOT** create a pull request, instead on your last commit assign title **last commit**, you will be evaluated based on that
+ **Go beyond!**, we greatly encourage you to go the extra mile and be bold about proposing
**Good luck with your assessment**
